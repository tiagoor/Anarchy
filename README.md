A tool with the intend to help installing the amazing Arch Linux distribution. With the Anarchy Project you'll be able to automatize the installation using a simple script.

The Anarchy Project will be distributed in the following modalities:
 * A couple of scripts (through this repository);
 * A tool to build a new installation image (ISO) with the Anarchy Project scripts embedded;
 * A pre-built ISO;

**Attention:** Despite the project being stable and usable, this first release is a "prove of concept" and will be totally rewritten to Python in the near future. Also new features will be added gradually.


### Anarchy is NOT a Distribution ###

Despite the fact that the Anarchy Project WILL provide an installation image (ISO), we are NOT an Arch Linux based distribution. We merely want to help:
 * all those newbie users which are having a bad time with the Arch Linux installation;
 * users that constantly need to reinstall Arch Linux for testing purposes;
 * users that already know the installation process and are in a rush to do it;
 * users that want to automatize the Arch Linux installation process;


## Using Anarchy ##

In order to use Anarchy first you'll need to obtain it, this can be done following one of those guides:
 * [Build your own installation image](https://github.com/magnunleno/Anarchy/wiki/Builging-Your-Own-ISO-With-Anarchy);
 * Download the latest stable Anarchy Project source code ([zip](https://github.com/magnunleno/Anarchy/archive/master.zip) or [tar.gz](https://github.com/magnunleno/Anarchy/archive/master.tar.gz));
 * Clone the Anarchy Project repository;

After obtaining the Anarchy Project you'll need to customize it to your needs, this can be done editing the [anarchy.conf file](http://github.com/magnunleno/Anarchy/wiki/Anarchy.conf).

Then just run the anarchy.sh script with the following command:
```Shell
./anarchy.sh
```

Now lie back and watch the script do all the handwork. After the reboot you'll have a basic Arch Linux installation.

## Hacking ##

We are open for contributions, just fork the repository and submit your pull request. Also, any improvement suggestion, bug report or critic is welcome and can be done via [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/magnunleno/Anarchy/issues) or contacting any of the developers.

The Anarchy Project source code is straightforward and simple, as our favorite distribution we follow the KISS philosophy.
